# Object Orientation Intro Discussion Questions

## Instructions

Take 30 minutes and answer the following questions together. Take turns playing around with the code provided in Pry or IRB.

## Questions

1 . If the `Animal` class is defined like this:

```ruby
class Animal
  def species
    "cat"
  end
end
```

How would you

a. Make a new instance of `Animal`?
b. `puts` out to the terminal, the species of that new `Animal` instance?

2 . Although we all know that cats are the best species, not all animals are cats (unfortunately). How could you change the `Animal` class so that an instance of `animal` can have its species set to any species at all?

3 . We have the following class, and the following two instances of that class:

```ruby
class Animal
  def species
    "cat"
  end
end

maru = Animal.new
hanna = Animal.new
```

Given the above, what will the following return? Why?

```ruby
maru == hanna
```

4 . Given the following class:

```ruby
class Animal
  def species
    my_species = "cat"
  end

  def say_species
    puts "Hi! I'm a #{my_species}"
  end
end
```

What will happen when we invoke the following code?

```ruby
maru = Animal.new
maru.say_species
```

Is it broken? Why? How can you fix it?

5 . Reverse engineer this code (i.e., write the class that will make the code work as invoked below):

```ruby
frederick = Animal.new("bull")
frederick.species
# => "bull"
```

**Hint:** How can you instantiate, or *initialize*, an instance of a class with a given value? What kind of variable would you use so that that value can be shared across instance methods within a class?

6 . Given the following code:

```ruby
class Animal
  def initialize(species)
    @species = species
  end
end

lil_bub = Animal.new("cat")
```

What is the relationship between `lil_bub` and the `Animal` class?
